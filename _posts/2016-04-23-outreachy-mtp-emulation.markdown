So I managed to get accepted into Gnome's
[Outreachy](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/) project (horray!). It is a FOSS
internship program that is heavily inspired by Google Summer of Code. If all
goes well, I will be adding missing features to Qemu's usb-mtp emulation
(primarily read-support). More posts will follow during the internship period
which starts on May 23.
