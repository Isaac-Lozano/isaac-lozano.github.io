      This is a test of the web version of the 1024 metronome. Hopefully this is easier to use than the command-line version.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is still a work in progress, so bugs probably exist and functionality probably doesn't exist.

    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>
      There are three phases to using this RNG manip.
      <ol>
        <li>Finding Load Delay.</li>
        <li>Tuning the timer.</li>
        <li>RUN MODE.</li>
      </ol>
      You only need to find your Load Delay once per stage (It does change slightly
      between stages, it seems), but once you have your Load Delay value, you can
      skip step 1.
    </p>
    <h1>Finding load delay</h1>
    <p>
      To find load delay:
      <ol>
        <li>Set Load Delay and Target Frame to 0.</li>
        <li>Enter the level on a tick.</li>
        <li>
          Note which set you got and reference a 1024 list to find out what frame you
          landed on. (1024 list sold separately)
        </li>
        <li>Exit the level.</li>
        <li>Re-enter the level on another tick.</li>
        <li>Find out what frame you landed on again and note it down.</li>
        <li>
          Your load delay is `(second_entry_frame - first_entry_frame) % 1024`. (You
          can type the equation in google to calculate it. It should be a number in
          the range 0 to 1023)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h1>Everything else</h1>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set your Load Delay and Target Frame.</li>
        <li>Enter the level on a tick.</li>
        <li>Attempt your IL movement.</li>
        <li>
          Note which set you got and reference a 1024 list to find out what frame you
          landed on. (1024 list sold separately)
        </li>
        <li>Type in what frame you got into the "Frame Entered" field.</li>
        <li>Press "Delay Timer".</li>
        <li>Exit the level and go to step 2.</li>
      </ol>
      The first time you enter the stage is your "tuning set". This set is random
      as the program won't be synced until you tell it what set you have. Afterwards,
      the program should be synced and you should get sets near the target frame.
    </p>
    <h1>Fine tuning</h1>
    <p>
      If you find that you're consistently getting a frames that are +n frames away
      from the target set, your load delay may be off. To fix a bad load delay that
      is giving you a set n frames after the target set consistently, increase your
      load delay by n frames. Likewise, if you have a load delay which is giving you
      a set n frames before the target set consistently, decrease your load delay by
      n frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you are going for set 10, but keep landing on or around set
      18 consistently, increase your load delay by 8.
